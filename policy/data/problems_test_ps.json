Its chemical structure depends on the number and types of atoms in each of its molecules, as well as on how those atoms are arranged.\nOne property of a substance is its flavor, which is its odor and taste combined. The chemical structure of a substance determines both the kind of flavor it has and the strength of that flavor.\nSyrups containing flavorants are used to add flavor to snow cones.\nSubstances that have especially interesting and strong flavors are often added to food to change or enhance the food's flavor. These substances are called flavorants. Flavorants can be found in nature, made in a chemical factory, or both.\nOne example of a flavorant is methyl anthranilate. This flavorant is often used to add a grape flavor to syrups, candy, and other sweets. Methyl anthranilate is found naturally in certain types of grapes, but it can also be made by workers in a chemical factory.",

    "solution": "1. Read the question and context carefully to understand the problem.\nFarid is baking a pie and notices that the crust burns before the pie is fully cooked. He wonders what factors affect whether a pie crust will burn in the oven.\n\n2. Identify the available supplies and the type of materials needed to answer the question.\nFarid has the following supplies available: ingredients for pumpkin pie filling, ingredients for apple pie filling, two pie crusts made with white flour, a glass pie pan, an aluminum pie pan, and an oven.\n\n3. Consider the context of the question and the available supplies to determine which questions can be investigated with the set of materials.\nFarid can investigate the following question with the set of materials: Does a pie crust made with white flour burn more quickly when the pie is cooked in a glass pan or in an aluminum pan?\n\n4. Brainstorm possible experiments that could be conducted with the supplies.\nFarid could conduct an experiment to compare the burning time of a pie crust made with white flour when cooked in a glass pan versus an aluminum pan. He could also compare the burning time of a pie crust made with white flour when covered with aluminum foil versus when left uncovered.\n\n5. Select the most appropriate experiment to answer the question.\nThe most appropriate experiment to answer the question is to compare the burning time of a pie crust made with white flour when cooked in a glass pan versus an aluminum pan.\n\n6. Design the experiment and carry it out.\nFarid should prepare two pies with the same ingredients, one in a glass pan and one in an aluminum pan. He should then bake the pies in the oven and measure the time it takes for the crust to burn.\n\n7. Analyze the results and draw conclusions.\nFarid should compare the results of the two pies and draw conclusions about which type of pan causes the pie crust to burn more quickly.",
