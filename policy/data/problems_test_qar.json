    "answer": 0,
    "hint": "Read the text.\nInvertebrates make up the majority of Earth's living things, but there are many different groups, or phyla, of invertebrates. Jellyfish and sea anemone, for example, are both part of the phylum Cnidaria. Cnidaria comes from a Greek word that means \"nettle,\" a stinging type of plant. Cnidarians are known for the tentacles that surround their mouths, which they use to sting and capture prey. All species that belong in the Cnidaria phyla live exclusively in the ocean.\nAnother phylum of invertebrates found only in oceans is the Echinodermata, a term that comes from Greek words meaning \"spiny\" and \"skin.\" Echinoderms, members of this phylum, have stiff bodies and often have stiff, sharp spines covering their skins. Unlike a cnidarian's wavy tentacles, these spines are used for protection, not to capture prey.",

    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "hint": "A substance's physical and chemical properties are all determined by its chemical structure. Its chemical structure depends on the number and types of atoms in each of its molecules, as well as on how those atoms are arranged.\nOne property of a substance is its flavor, which is its odor and taste combined. The chemical structure of a substance determines both the kind of flavor it has and the strength of that flavor.\nSyrups containing flavorants are used to add flavor to snow cones.\nSubstances that have especially interesting and strong flavors are often added to food to change or enhance the food's flavor. These substances are called flavorants. Flavorants can be found in nature, made in a chemical factory, or both.\nOne example of a flavorant is methyl anthranilate. This flavorant is often used to add a grape flavor to syrups, candy, and other sweets. Methyl anthranilate is found naturally in certain types of grapes, but it can also be made by workers in a chemical factory.",

He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel.
